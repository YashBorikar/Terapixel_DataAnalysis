# Technical data analysis of cloud-based visualization for rendering terapixal generated by public IaaS

Under the Technical Data Analysis of Cloud-based Visualization section, the candidate conducted an analysis of cloud-based visualization for rendering terapixel of 3D city visualization generated by public IaaS cloud GPU nodes using environmental data captured by Newcastle Urban Observatory. The analysis involved quantifying the computation requirements for tiles generation and analyzing the interplay between GPU temperature and performance, as well as increased power draw and render time. The candidate utilized their expertise in data analysis to derive meaningful insights that can be used to optimize the visualization process and improve the overall performance of the system. Through this technical data analysis, the candidate has demonstrated their proficiency in handling large data sets and conducting complex computations to extract valuable insights.
