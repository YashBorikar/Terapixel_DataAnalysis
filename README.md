# Technical data analysis of cloud-based visualization for rendering terapixal generated by public IaaS

This project focuses on conducting data analysis of cloud-based visualization for rendering terapixel of 3D city visualization generated by public IaaS cloud GPU nodes using environmental data captured by Newcastle Urban Observatory. The data analysis includes quantifying computation requirements for tiles generation and analyzing the interplay between GPU temperature and performance, as well as increased power draw and render time.

Specifically, the analysis explores the relationships between the environmental data captured by Newcastle Urban Observatory, such as temperature and humidity, and the GPU performance and power consumption during the rendering process. The findings of the analysis will provide insights into optimizing the rendering process for large-scale 3D city visualization on public IaaS cloud GPU nodes.

Overall, this project aims to contribute to the development of efficient and effective rendering techniques for terapixel-scale 3D city visualization in the context of cloud-based visualization, which is becoming increasingly important for urban planning, management, and communication.
